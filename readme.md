## Project Descriptions
Explore our machine learning projects to gain insights and hands-on experience in different areas of predictive modeling:

Linear Regression: Learn about simple linear regression techniques where we model the relationship between a single input feature and the target variable.

Multiple Regression: Dive deeper into multiple regression, where we predict a target variable using multiple input features.

Outlier Treatment in Data Analysis: Discover the methods and techniques used to identify and manage outliers in your datasets, ensuring data quality and model accuracy.

[Include brief descriptions and links to each project in your repository.]

## Getting Started
To get started with any of the projects in this repository, follow these general steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/vishalcjgit/ml

Navigate to the specific project folder of your choice.

Refer to the project's README and Jupyter notebooks to understand the problem, dataset, and the steps taken in the analysis.

Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to explore, model, and evaluate the data.

## Folder Structure
The repository is organized into project-specific folders, making it easy to find and explore each project. The folder structure for each project typically includes:

data/: Contains the dataset(s) used for the analysis.
